todo
----
- register routes --> done, may have to change it according to the event-engine
- logging
- handle requests with an event engine --> something like the function Dance in Perl-Dancer ?
- parse HTTP 
- respond valid HTTP
- define what is a $path in a *nix way (delegation to a standard tool ? sed? awk?)
- maybe re-organize the sourcecode --> if it becomes too big
- maybe netcat integration --> first version as a CGI with inetd ?
- handle concurent requests
- what else?


directory structure
-------------------
For now nothing, but potentially :
- log/
- lib/
- doc/
- scripts/
